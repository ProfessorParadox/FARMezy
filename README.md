# FARMezy
Our team created an app named FARMezy paired with a Raspberry Pi unit (& sensors), which implements smart farming practices with ease, aiding famers to manage crop plantations & receive market safety (for sales, using blockchain tech) on a unified platform.

*	Design intricate Machine Learning Models running on cloud to provide various predictions; and a live Object Detection Model (Deep L) for crop vandalism alert.

*	Program a Flutter framework & Firebase based mobile application, deployed on Android & iOS Platforms, working in sync with cloud-based models.

### Project Overview
* FARMezy is a Smart Farming based system that will provide the farmers with all the necessary tools required for good production. From monitoring the pollution levels to sensing the amount of irrigation required, it will provide all the details at one location. 

* This system will help manage the crop health efficiently by using the combined applications of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).

* It promotes precision agriculture which will enable reduction of overall costs and the improvement of the quality and quantity of products, the sustainability of agriculture and the experience for the masses.

* The project will incorporate effective solution to crop vandalism. As the limitation of protecting crops from animals becomes a major concern for yield, a powerful neural network using computer vision is planned to be developed to curb the issue. 

* The project will also include the concept of Blockchain Technology to ensure that the farmers are paid fairly. The amount of supply of the produce from the farmers along with the details including the price at which it was sold as well as the MSP at that particular time will be stored in a hashnode in a blockchain. This will ensure the financial stability of the farmers.
